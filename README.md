# Divisors

A thread finds which integer between 1 and n has the largest number of divisors and the number of divisors it has. It is possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of divisors. The program only prints out one of them.

If it takes more than x seconds to proccess, the thread gets interrupted and prints what it has found so far during that time.
